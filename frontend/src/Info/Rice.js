        "Temperature": {
            "Optimal Range": "Rice grows best in warm conditions, with an ideal temperature range of 25°C to 35°C during the growing season.",
            "Germination": "Seeds require a minimum temperature of about 10°C for germination, but higher temperatures enhance growth."
        },
        "Rainfall": {
            "Water Needs": "Rice is a water-intensive crop that thrives in areas with abundant rainfall.",
            "Ideal Rainfall": "An average annual rainfall of 1000 mm to 3000 mm is suitable. Monsoon rains provide the necessary moisture.",
            "Irrigation": "In areas with less rainfall, supplementary irrigation is necessary, especially during dry spells."
        },
        "Humidity": {
            "High_Humidity": "Rice prefers a humid environment, which helps in the growth of the plant and the filling of grains.",
            "Avoiding_Drought": "Prolonged dry conditions can adversely affect crop yield."
        },
        "Soil Conditions": {
            "Soil Type": "Well-drained loamy or clayey soils are ideal. Rice can also grow in flooded soils (paddy fields) but should have good drainage after the rainy season.",
            "Soil pH": "A pH range of 5.5 to 7.0 is optimal."

    "Growing Period": {
        "Kharif Season": {
            "Sowing time": "Typically planted between June and July, just before the onset of the monsoon.",
            "Germination": "Seeds germinate within 7 to 10 days after planting, depending on soil moisture and temperature.",
            "Growth stages": "The crop goes through various stages, including seedling, tillering, flowering, and ripening."
        },
        "Harversting": {
            "Maturity": "The crop is usually ready for harvest in October to November, approximately 120 to 150 days after sowing.",
            "Signs of maturity": "Harvesting occurs when the grains are hard and the leaves start turning yellow."
        },
        "Post-harvest": {
            "Drying": "After harvesting, rice needs to be dried properly to reduce moisture content before storage to prevent spoilage."
